# git directory is $HOME/.dotfiles.git (bare repo)
# working directory is $HOME

# ignore everything in root of $HOME including:
# regular directories, files, etc.
# untracked dotfiles (.ssh, .rubies, .gem, etc.)
# the repo should also ignore itself (.dotfiles.git)
/*

# need to un-ignore parent dirs before un-ignoring any of their contents
# e.g., !/.bundle/

# re-ignore contents of parents; whitelist specific items below
# e.g., /.bundle/*

# don't ignore things related to the repo
!.gitignore

# don't ignore the main dotfiles (everything below)
